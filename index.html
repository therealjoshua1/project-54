            the reason like Chip and Dale is because they have a very intresting story and funny things like the Donald Duck is stuck in a canon tingy mobab and Chip and Dale put an beehive in the tingy mobab and the bees think that Donald Duck did destroy their home so they attack Donald Duck and Donald Duck went boom
